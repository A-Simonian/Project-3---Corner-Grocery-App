"# Project-3---Corner-Grocery-App" \
**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**\
This project is for CS-210 at SNHU. The program reads in data from a text file that simulates items sold for a day from a grocery store. Using this data
a user is able to use a menu to search for a specific item and see the quantity sold for a day, print list of items sold and quantity, print list of items and quantity as histogram,
and an option to exit program

**What did you do particularly well?** \
I think the coding I did is well organized and not overly complicated 

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?** \
The code could be enhanced in the reading of data. While I checked to see if files are open, there are no checks for errors in the reading/writing of data. Also 
I think the freeing of memory was handled properly but that is something that I would revist with more knowledge on the subject to see if there could be improvements. 

**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?** \
This project required the use of pointers which was a difficult concept. Many youtube videos were watched to help understand the concept of pointers along with Zybooks for the course.
Also the use of debugging and break points to see exactly what was going on with pointers helped to overcome and truly see how pointers work.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?** \
Working with classes and gaining more experience in Object oriented design is greatly beneficial to other projects and course work on this computer science journey.

**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?** \
This project used an Object oriented approach which allows the code to be expanded on. The ability to add a specific type of GroceryItem object that inherits from GroceryItem
Also the use of clear comments aids in the readability of the code.
